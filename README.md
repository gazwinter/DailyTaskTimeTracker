# DailyTaskTimeTracker

![Android Build](https://github.com/gazwinter/DailyTaskTimeTracker/workflows/CI%20on%20Push%20and%20Pull%20Request/badge.svg)

App that allows the user to keep a track of the time it takes them to do individual tasks

At the moment this is just a hobby project while I play around with Prism, but in future who knows what it will be!
